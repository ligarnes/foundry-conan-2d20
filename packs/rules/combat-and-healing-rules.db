These are variously referred to as <strong>Mobs</strong> and <strong>Squads</strong>, the two terms reflecting a number of common differences between otherwise similar groupings.</p>\n<p><strong>A Mob</strong> consists of up to five identical Minions acting as a rough, unruly, and poorly disciplined group. There is no distinct leader, and while the Mob is more effective in battle than the individuals that comprise it, it is still a poor force and often falters against a more disciplined foe. Groups of natural animals often form Mobs, especially when there is no distinct pack leader.</p>\n<p><strong>A Squad</strong> consists of a single Toughened creature &mdash; referred to as a Leader &mdash; leading up to four identical Minions. The Minions&rsquo; abilities are put into direct support of the Toughened creature&rsquo;s actions, making it more effective and more resilient in battle. In some situations, a Nemesis or even a player character can be a Squad&rsquo;s Leader, following exactly the same rules.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Taking action</h3>\n<p>Mobs and Squads both take action as single entities, regardless of the number of creatures that comprise a given group. Each group gets a single turn each combat round, during which they must all take the same action.</p>\n<p>When a group takes an action requiring a test, nominate a single creature within the group &mdash; in the case of a Squad this will always be the Leader &mdash; to lead the action. This creature is the one taking the action, for all intents and purposes. Each creature in the group not leading the action contributes a single d20 to the test, using their own attributes and skills, effectively assisting the nominated creature&rsquo;s actions. In the case of a Mob, all the creatures&rsquo; attributes and skills for a given test should be the same, regardless of which creature is leading the action.</p>\n<p>The dice gained from being part of a Mob or a Squad are, as already noted, a form of assistance (multiple characters contributing towards a single task), and thus do not count towards the normal limit of three bonus d20s.</p>\n<p>Consequently, Mobs and Squads can still benefit from bonus d20s in the normal ways &mdash; spending Doom, spending resources, etc.</p>"},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"1AtfmF8py9obPbg0"}

This is automatic, requiring only a brief rest. The only time this should not happen is if the next scene is set immediately after the prior, with the characters having no time to recuperate.</p>\n<p>Stress is recovered at a slower rate within an action scene, though it never reaches a higher value than the character&rsquo;s normal maximum. Spending 1 point of Momentum (Immediate, Repeatable) allows a character to recover 1 point of any Stress.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, characters can spend actions to try to recover their own or an ally&rsquo;s Stress during an</p>\n<p>action scene. These treatment actions are described in the Counsel and Healing skill descriptions (pages 62 and 66).</p>\n<p>Recovering from Harm is a trickier proposition, <strong>requiring two stages: treatment and healing</strong>. Restoring lost Harm cannot be done during an action scene, except under the most extraordinary of measures or conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>To treat Harm</strong>, the treating character must choose what kind of Harm is being treated and must attempt an Average (D1) skill test using a skill determined by the type of damage. If successful, this test removes 1 Harm, plus 1 additional Harm for each Momentum spent (Repeatable).</p>\n<p><strong>A treated Harm no longer imposes any Difficulty increase</strong>, nor does it count towards the character&rsquo;s maximum, but it is not yet completely healed. Until a treated Harm has been completely healed, the character is still vulnerable and the Harm is still present, if latent. If a character suffers a new Harm of that type, any treated Harms immediately return as Wounds or Trauma, reopening under strain.</p>\n<p>Completely healing from Harm takes time, proper medical attention, or a combination of both. The pace of healing is at the gamemaster&rsquo;s discretion, and normally occurs at&nbsp;points in an adventure where the characters stop and rest or&nbsp;in the downtime between adventures. Healing completely removes all Harms the character suffers from, treated or otherwise.
