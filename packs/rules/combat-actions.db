The player nominates a target the character is able to perceive, and attempts an Average (D1) Observation test (modified for Observation tests by distance, lighting, etc.). If this succeeds, the character’s first attack before the end of the next turn gains the Piercing 2 Quality. If desired, the character may spend one Momentum from this test to add one bonus d20 to the attack’s skill test, and +1§ to the attack’s damage. This is Repeatable, but these bonus d20s count towards the normal limit of 3 bonus d20s on any skill test. The benefits of this action are only gained once per round. This action can also represent attempts to ambush, feint, or attack with some other significant advantage. Gamemasters may allow characters to use skills other than Observation to attempt an Exploit action, and the gamemaster may modify the Difficulty to represent more or less vulnerable targets. Stealth is the most likely skill to test, but Persuade (representing a trick or deception) or Acrobatics (representing some grand feat of agility) are also viable options. The gamemaster is encouraged to let players have fun with this option. In situations where the skill test’s Difficulty is Simple (D0), Exploit may be used as a Free Action."},"img":"systems/conan2d20/asset/image/rule.png","effects":[]}
